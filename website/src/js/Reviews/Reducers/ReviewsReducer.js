      comment: "Highly recommend this cute little dress shop! I usually dislike shopping for dresses due to my curvy figure that makes dress fittings a nightmare, but Neha made this such a fun and easy experience!! She helped me to get in/out of the dresses and give her honest opinion about it.I told Neha roughly what Im looking for, and she immediately came up with few great options. I tried one on and LOVED it. It was flattering and looked beautiful from every angle. The halter top was a bit too loose, so she tailored it in 24 hours for a very reasonable price! I was so impressed. I had prepared myself for a frustrating few hours of trying on dresses that don't fit, but instead I finished my shopping in less than an hour, and walked out feeling happy and relieved. Look no further if you need beautiful dresses at a reasonable price, with unbeatable friendly and knowledgeable customer service. Thank you, Neha!",
