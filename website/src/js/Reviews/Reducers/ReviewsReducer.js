      comment: "Highly recommend this cute little dress shop! I usually dislike shopping for dresses due to my curvy figure which makes dress fittings a nightmare, but Neha made this such a fun and easy experience! She helped me try on dresses and give her honest opinion about them. I told Neha roughly what I am looking for, and she immediately came up with few great options. I tried one on and LOVED it. It was flattering and looked beautiful from every angle. The halter top was a bit too loose, so she made alterations within 24 hours for a very reasonable price! I was so impressed. I had prepared myself for a frustrating few hours of trying on dresses that wouldn’t fit, but instead I finished my shopping in less than an hour, and walked out feeling happy and relieved. Look no further if you need beautiful dresses at a reasonable price, with unbeatable friendly and knowledgeable customer service. Thank you, Neha!",

Neha went above and beyond to ensure  I was comfortable; she even explained the differences between types of fabrics, textures etc. Thanks Neha, my wife is going to love her new dress!",
